# Variable: It is a space where we can able to store any value or data.
# Identifier: Identifier is a identity to the variable/class/function etc.
a=10;# here a is an identity to a variable where we are storing 10 in it.
a


#print() is a predefined function that is using to display any data as an output.
b=20
print(a)
print(b)

#id() it is also a predefined function that used to get an unique id number to the variabes.
print(id(a))
print(id(b))


#In python Capital A and Small a are different because it is a case sensitive language.
A=10
a=30
print(A)
print(a)

#Rule of the identifiers or naming convensions
 #1-We can define the identifier name with both uppercase and lowercase letters. 
A=50
b=60
 #2-We can start the identifier name with uppercase and lowercase letters and also with the special character _ 
_h=80
 #3-Only _ will be used in the identifier names, no other characters are not allowed.
 #4-keywords are not used as identifiers.keywords are the predefined words that have it's own defination or meaning or specific task
 #5-In python we are having 35 keywords. All the keywords are started with small letters only except True, False, None.
 #6-spaces are not allowed in between the identifier names.
 #7-We can't able to start the identifier names with numbers, but we can used in the middle of the identifiers.
 #8-We can give any length to a variabe name.
print(A)
print(b)
print(_h)

#we are having two types of functions such as built-in functions and user defined functions
#We are having two tyes of modules such as built-in modules and user defined modules.
#We are having two types of classes such as built-in classes and user defined classes
